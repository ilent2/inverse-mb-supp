This repository contains supplementary code for

>  Inverse-Fourier Non-diffracting Beams for Optical Trapping,
>  Manuel Alberto MartÄ±nez-Ruiz, et al. [Journal TBD], [LINK TODO], 2020.

If you find any of this code useful, please consider citing our paper.
Some of this code will be included an upcoming release of the
[optical tweezers toolbox](https://github.com/ilent2/ott).

Requirements
------------

  * Optical Tweezers Toolbox (version 1, should work with 1.5.6)
  * Matlab (tested on R2018a)

Usage
-----

The repository consists of a series of example code files used
to generate different parts of the figures in the paper.
Start by looking through the `example_` files.

Other files contains functions/classes used by the `example_` files.
You will need the optical tweezers toolbox (version 1) to run most
parts, make sure it is installed and added to Matlab's path.
Most of these files will be merged with the optical tweezers toolbox
at some later date.

Files
-----

  * `example_regular_mb_ottv1.m` Generate a regular Mathieu beam
    using the BscBessel class from OTTv1.

  * `example_inverse_mb.m` Generate an inverse Mathieu beam for use
    in OTT using the `BscPmMathieu` class.

  * `example_paraxial_mb.m` Example showing how paraxial Mathieu beams
    can be simulated.

  * `MathieuExample.mlx` Matlab live-script example, produces a similar
    result to `example_inverse_mb.m` but in a live-script.

  * `Mathieu.m` Functions used by `example_regular_mb_ottv1.m`, some
    are duplicated in `BscPmMathieu.m`.

  * `BscPmMathieu.m` generates an inverse Mathieu beam using point
    matching in the far-field.  Uses OTTv1 `BscPmParaxial` class.
